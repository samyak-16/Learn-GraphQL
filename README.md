# How GraphQL Works as a Proxy Between Multiple Backend Services

Suppose you have the following setup:

- **Node.js REST API** → handles normal CRUD operations (e.g., `/users`)
- **Python REST API** → handles AI-related work (e.g., `/projects`, `/history`)
- **Frontend** → wants combined data like user's name, AI projects, history, etc.

In a normal REST setup:

1. The frontend would need to make multiple requests:

   - `/users` → returns full user JSON (name, email, age, etc.)
   - `/projects` → returns all AI projects
   - `/history` → returns all history

2. The frontend then has to:
   - Extract only the needed fields (e.g., name from `/users`)
   - Filter out unwanted data
   - Merge results manually into a single response

This increases **frontend complexity** and makes the app harder to maintain.

### Step-by-Step High-Level Flow with GraphQL as Proxy

1. **Frontend Request**

   - Frontend sends a single request asking exactly for the data it needs (e.g., user’s name, AI projects, history).

2. **GraphQL Server Receives Request**

   - The GraphQL server acts as a **middle layer** (proxy).
   - It is usually hosted separately from Node.js or Python services.

3. **Internal Requests to Backend Services**

   - GraphQL server sends requests to:
     - Node.js `/users` API to fetch user information
     - Python `/projects` and `/history` APIs to fetch AI-related data

4. **Data Collection and Filtering**

   - GraphQL collects **all responses**, including extra fields not needed by the frontend.
   - It filters out the unwanted fields and keeps only the requested information.

5. **Data Aggregation**

   - GraphQL combines the relevant fields from both Node.js and Python responses into **one unified JSON object**.

6. **Response to Frontend**
   - The frontend receives a **single response** with exactly the data it requested:
     - User name
     - AI projects
     - History

### Key Points

- GraphQL acts as a **smart aggregator/proxy**.
- Frontend complexity is reduced because it only makes **one request**.
- GraphQL filters and merges data from multiple backends **behind the scenes**.
- The backend services remain independent; GraphQL just orchestrates and combines their responses.
- While GraphQL mainly reduces frontend load, it can also optimize backend calls if configured smartly.
